## Problem 1

**Dataset Description**

- size and structure of the data
- describe some key variables
- indicate the extent to which missing data is an issue

#### Task 1

Do some data cleaning. Create separate variables for year, month, and
day. Ensure observations for temperature, precipitation, and snowfall
are given in reasonable units. For snowfall, what are the most commonly
observed values? Why?

#### Task 2

Make a two-panel plot showing the average max temperature in January and
in July in each station across years. Is there any observable /
interpretable structure? Any outliers?

#### Task 3

Make a two-panel plot showing (i) tmax vs tmin for the full dataset
(note that a scatterplot may not be the best option); and (ii) make a
plot showing the distribution of snowfall values greater than 0 and less
than 100 separately by year.

## Problem 2

#### Task 1

Load, tidy, merge, and otherwise organize the data sets. Your final
dataset should include all originally observed variables; exclude
participants less than 21 years of age, and those with missing
demographic data; and encode data with reasonable variable classes
(i.e.Â not numeric, and using factors with the ordering of tables and
plots in mind).

#### Task 2

Produce a reader-friendly table for the number of men and women in each
education category, and create a visualization of the age distributions
for men and women in each education category. Comment on these items.

#### Task 3

Traditional analyses of accelerometer data focus on the total activity
over the day. Using your tidied dataset, aggregate across minutes to
create a total activity variable for each participant. Plot these total
activities (y-axis) against age (x-axis); your plot should compare men
to women and have separate panels for each education level. Include a
trend line or a smooth to illustrate differences. Comment on your plot.

#### Task 4

Accelerometer data allows the inspection activity over the course of the
day. Make a three-panel plot that shows the 24-hour activity time
courses for each education level and use color to indicate sex. Describe
in words any patterns or conclusions you can make based on this graph;
including smooth trends may help identify differences.

## Problem 3

``` r
# data on rides taken on the NYC Citi Bike system. Files contain 1% of all rides with a total duration less than 4 hours in each of four months.
```

#### Task 1

Import, clean, and tidy these data, and describe the resulting dataset.

#### Task 2

Produce a reader-friendly table showing the total number of rides in
each combination of year and month separating casual riders and Citi
Bike members. Comment on these results.

#### Task 3

Make a table showing the 5 most popular starting stations for July 2024;
include the number of rides originating from these stations.

#### Task 4

Make a plot to investigate the effects of day of the week, month, and
year on median ride duration. This plot can include one or more panels,
but should facilitate comparison across all variables of interest.
Comment on your observations from this plot.

#### Task 5

There were relatively few electric Citi Bikes in 2020, but many more are
available now. For data in 2024, make a figure that shows the impact of
month, membership status, and bike type on the distribution of ride
duration. Comment on your results.
